Description: This package is a copy of the navfn package, with a small edit to allow for setting of the goal_tolerance param at runtime. The navfn package is currently maintained by David V. Lu!! davidvlu@gmail.com and Michael Ferguson mferguson@fetchrobotics.com navfn provides a fast interpolated navigation function that can be used to create plans for a mobile base. The planner assumes a circular robot and operates on a costmap to find a minimum cost plan from a start point to an end point in a grid. The navigation function is computed with Dijkstra's algorithm, but support for an A* heuristic may also be added in the near future. navfn also provides a ROS wrapper for the navfn planner that adheres to the nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface specified in nav_core.
