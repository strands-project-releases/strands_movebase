ros-indigo-strands-movebase (0.0.14-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * getting move base's own costmap clearance to clear the obstacle layer
  * reverting resolution as it is too much for the current depth cloud config and it creates a lot of lingering obstacles
  * new nav params
  * defaul user needs to be ""
  * Fixed indentation
  * Added remove_edges_laser to install targets
  * Made the calculation of the new points exact
  * Changed default arguments to make clear that they are floats
  * Added the new node in the launch file and included the decreased FOV obstacle adding laser in the sensor sources
  * Now it should work
  * Added a node that remove the edges of the laser

ros-indigo-strands-movebase (0.0.9-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * fixing wrong machine tag
  * More precise footprint of the robot, including screen.
  * Cosmetic changes of costmap_common_params.yaml.
  * Renamed config.launch to obstacles.launch
  * Moved move_base to the main machine.
    Obstacle handling with the chest xtion still run on the chest xtion's pc.
  * Since *any* tag supports if, no need to dup nodes.
  * Purely syntactic changes to move_base/launch
    Because I'm allergic to working with inconsistent files.
