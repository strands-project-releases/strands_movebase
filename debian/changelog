ros-hydro-strands-movebase (0.0.11-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Made the voxel map publish only for the local costmap as it might be demanding to publish the global
  * Fixed publishing of the occupied voxel map
  * Ability to include site-specific movebase parameters.

ros-hydro-strands-movebase (0.0.9-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * fixing wrong machine tag
  * More precise footprint of the robot, including screen.
  * Cosmetic changes of costmap_common_params.yaml.
  * Renamed config.launch to obstacles.launch
  * Moved move_base to the main machine.
    Obstacle handling with the chest xtion still run on the chest xtion's pc.
  * Since *any* tag supports if, no need to dup nodes.
  * Purely syntactic changes to move_base/launch
    Because I'm allergic to working with inconsistent files.

ros-hydro-strands-movebase (0.0.8-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #13 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_movebase/issues/13> from nilsbore/backtrack
    [strands_movebase] Add option to use head_camera as well
  * Changed the unknown_threshold to 9 as well for consistency
  * Removed commented code
  * Removed unnecessary code and switched to the topics used in backtrack
  * Fixed the parameter settings, it actually works
  * Tidied up a bit and changed to the correct topic
  * Forgot to change the height
  * Added the option to have an extra head camera, with a higher voxelgrid

ros-hydro-strands-movebase (0.0.7-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * final and tested version of loader
  * new machine tags
  * Fixed typos in launch files
  * Added launch file options for changing the obstacle and stair heights to enable to tune the robustness

ros-hydro-strands-movebase (0.0.6-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Decreased the cost_scaling_factor, making the robot stay away from walls if possible. This made navigation more robust on Rosie, particularly through doors

ros-hydro-strands-movebase (0.0.5-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * added changelogs
  * Added launching of chest transform state publisher together with 3d movebase
  * Added the dependencies in catkin_package
  * Placed include files in include/strands_movebase and added install targets
  * Modified config.launch to use strands_movebase nodes and configs instead of scitos_2d_navigation
  * Renamed the launch files and made 3d obstacle avoidance the default
  * Corrected the homepage
  * Moved the headers to include folder
  * Removed move_base.launch since that will be in scitos_2d_navigation
  * Mad strands_movebase a package within the repo, to be able to put e.g. chest_calibration in another package
