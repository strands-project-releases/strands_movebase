0.0.21 (2015-04-27)
-------------------
* Changed the machine tags to be able to launch the head camera processing nodes on the correct pc
* Contributors: Nils Bore

0.0.18 (2015-03-28)
-------------------
* Added dependency to state service since it is included in launch file
* Contributors: Nils Bore

0.0.17 (2015-03-16)
-------------------
* really correcting import
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into indigo-devel
* correcting imports
* Avoiding planning through Unknown Areas by adding tracking of unknown obstacles and not allowing them
* adding slight inflation to local costmap
* Not copying the intensities vector in remove_edges_laser if there are no values in the input message
* setting unknown_cost_value to 100
* Contributors: Bruno Lacerda, Jaime Pulido Fentanes, Nils Bore

0.0.16 (2015-02-13)
-------------------

0.0.14 (2014-12-17)
-------------------
* getting move base's own costmap clearance to clear the obstacle layer
* reverting resolution as it is too much for the current depth cloud config and it creates a lot of lingering obstacles
* new nav params
* defaul user needs to be ""
* Fixed indentation
* Added remove_edges_laser to install targets
* Made the calculation of the new points exact
* Changed default arguments to make clear that they are floats
* Added the new node in the launch file and included the decreased FOV obstacle adding laser in the sensor sources
* Now it should work
* Added a node that remove the edges of the laser
* Contributors: Bruno Lacerda, Nils Bore

0.0.13 (2014-11-21)
-------------------
* Made subsampling parameters configurable.
* Whitespace only while I'm at it.
* Contributors: Lucas Beyer

0.0.12 (2014-11-20)
-------------------
* Set the obstacle adding thresholds to more reasonable values
* Contributors: Nils Bore

0.0.11 (2014-11-19)
-------------------
* Made the voxel map publish only for the local costmap as it might be demanding to publish the global
* Fixed publishing of the occupied voxel map
* Ability to include site-specific movebase parameters.
* Contributors: Lucas Beyer, Nils Bore

0.0.10 (2014-11-19)
-------------------

0.0.9 (2014-11-19)
------------------
* fixing wrong machine tag
* More precise footprint of the robot, including screen.
* Cosmetic changes of `costmap_common_params.yaml`.
* Renamed config.launch to obstacles.launch
* Moved `move_base` to the main machine.
  Obstacle handling with the chest xtion still run on the chest xtion's pc.
* Since *any* tag supports `if`, no need to dup nodes.
* Purely syntactic changes to move_base/launch
  Because I'm allergic to working with inconsistent files.
* Contributors: Jaime Pulido Fentanes, Lucas Beyer

0.0.8 (2014-11-12)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#13 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_movebase/issues/13>`_ from nilsbore/backtrack
  [strands_movebase] Add option to use head_camera as well
* Changed the unknown_threshold to 9 as well for consistency
* Removed commented code
* Removed unnecessary code and switched to the topics used in backtrack
* Fixed the parameter settings, it actually works
* Tidied up a bit and changed to the correct topic
* Forgot to change the height
* Added the option to have an extra head camera, with a higher voxelgrid
* Contributors: Marc Hanheide, Nils Bore, Rares Ambrus

0.0.7 (2014-11-09)
------------------
* final and tested version of loader
* new machine tags
* Fixed typos in launch files
* Added launch file options for changing the obstacle and stair heights to enable to tune the robustness
* Contributors: Jaime Pulido Fentanes, Nils Bore, Rares Ambrus

0.0.6 (2014-10-27)
------------------
* Decreased the cost_scaling_factor, making the robot stay away from walls if possible. This made navigation more robust on Rosie, particularly through doors
* Contributors: Nils Bore

0.0.5 (2014-10-23)
------------------
* added changelogs
* Added launching of chest transform state publisher together with 3d movebase
* Added the dependencies in catkin_package
* Placed include files in include/strands_movebase and added install targets
* Modified config.launch to use strands_movebase nodes and configs instead of scitos_2d_navigation
* Renamed the launch files and made 3d obstacle avoidance the default
* Corrected the homepage
* Moved the headers to include folder
* Removed move_base.launch since that will be in scitos_2d_navigation
* Mad strands_movebase a package within the repo, to be able to put e.g. chest_calibration in another package
* Contributors: Marc Hanheide, Nils Bore
