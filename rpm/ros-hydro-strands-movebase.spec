%description
This package contains components for using the ROS move base together with the
Scitos G5 robot. There is options for running obstacle avoidance both with only
laser and with an additional depth-sensing camera mounted in front. The
additional nodes in the package are for processing the incoming clouds from the
camera for obstacle avoidance.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
